# VHDL

- The below two algorithms are fed with the same data by taking absolute magnitudes in positive frequency and negative frequency, where as the detections are better in the OS-CFAR algorithm


## OS-CFAR Algorithm
- This is a RADAR detection algorithm performs better in homogeneous environments.


## OS-CFAR Algorithm
- This is another RADAR detection algorithm performs better in multiple target environments.
