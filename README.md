# VHDL

- The below two algorithms are fed with the same data, where as the detections are better in the OS-CFAR algorithm

## CA-CFAR Algorithm
- This project is a detection algorithmin in one of the RADAR Techniques. This performs better in homogeneous environments.

## OS-CFAR Algorithm
- This is another RADAR detection algorithm performs better in multiple target environments.
